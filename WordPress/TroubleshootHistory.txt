Purpouse: 
        This JSON file should be used in CloudFormation 
        to create secure WEB application with a Bastion Host, 
        NAT Gateway and Application Load Balancer.
1. Created first version of ClodFormation configuration, defined all necessary components.
2. Check template for existing syntax errors:
    - Load this configuration in the ClodFormation template designer;
    - Found sytax error and fix it;
    - Repeat steps above while all errors have been fixed;
    Main errors that were found at this step: missing curly and square bracket at the end of logical blocks 
3. Try to create stack.
    - Load json template as file, start to create stack and see if stack will be created.
    - In failure case see what part of template prevented from successfull creation
    and try to find out reason and fix problem.
    - Repeat steps above to finalizing stack creation.
    Main logical errors have been found:
        - Wrong attribute names used (contained errors);
        - PolicyType in AutoScaling policy block was defined incorrect:
        "TargetTrackingScaling" should be used.
4. Stack has been created successfully, but WEB application didn't work properly
    (It was no wordpress page presented at the LoadBalancer URL).
    To find out reason I connected to one of the instances via Bastion host.
    I recognized, that bootstrap script did not make necessary changes into the system:
    system was not updated, mysql, http, php and wordpress were not be installed.
    Checked internet connectivity - absented.
    Try figure out the reason - found out wrong CIDR block in the one of NACL.
    Fixed error and recreated the stack.
    Still no wordpress page presented at the LoadBalancer URL.
    Connected via ssh to Application instance.
    Figured out that latest version of wordpress does not work with php-5.4.16 installed.
    Changed version of wordpress in bootstrap script for 5.1.1.
    Recreate stack.
5.  Stack successfully created, wordpress start page appeared.
